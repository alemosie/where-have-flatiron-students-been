# where-have-flatiron-students-been

My vision for this week 1 personal project is to create a command line interface where people can input places, and have those places be recorded in a central location for easy access. It's at once a way to practice using unfamiliar APIs (in this case, the Google Places API), and to get to know my classmates a little better!
